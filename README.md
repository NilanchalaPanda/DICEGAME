This repository contains the code for a captivating and interactive two-player dice game implemented in JavaScript. The game follows a set of rules designed to create an engaging and competitive experience. Here are the rules of the game:

1️⃣ The game requires two players.
2️⃣ Each player takes turns rolling a six-sided dice.
3️⃣ The initial value is 0.
4️⃣ When a player rolls the dice, the number on the dice is added to their current value.
5️⃣ If the player rolls a "one" on the dice, their turn ends, and the other player gets a chance to play.
6️⃣ Additionally, if the player decides to "hold" their current value, their turn ends, and the other player gets a chance to play.
7️⃣ The first player to reach or exceed 100 points wins the game; and then you can start a NEW GAME.

🚀 The purpose of this repository is to provide a clear and well-documented implementation of the game logic, allowing developers to understand and extend the game as desired. The code is organized into separate modules, including a main game module, player modules, and dice module. Each module contains functions and classes that handle specific aspects of the game.
